# Python Journey

This repository documents my daily Python practice,
focused on building strong fundamentals through
practical programs and projects.
Each folder represents a learning milestone with
working code and incremental improvements.

## Day 4 – Score Analyzer

Concepts practiced:
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Edge case handling

Project:
- A program that collects multiple scores,
  calculates total, average, highest and lowest values,
  and outputs a Pass/Fail result.

  ## Day 5 – Score Categorizer
- Categorized scores using conditions inside loops
- Counted pass/fail cases
- Calculated percentages
- Handled empty input safely
